1. make your browser window full screen
2. open a new tab
3. right click -> inspect
4. copy the index.html text content from the file that is given in the project
5. right click on the <html> element
6. click edit as html
7. paste the text for the index.html file into the DOM inspector/DOM explorer

now for the task

1. drag the window (width ONLY) to make the width smaller
2. make the width be 400px (or smaller if the browser will let you)
3. scroll to the bottom of the page to the horizontal scroll bar
4. click the horizontal scrollbar and drag to the far right of the page
5. the contact-root element's width needs to be fixed.

think about what needs to be fixed here and added as a solution.
the width of the id="container" element does not ever need to get any smaller in width no matter what.

write some code to make the page work like you think it should

let meh know once youre done

happy coding
